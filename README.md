The Ballers: Ty Chan and Katelyn Zhou (period 3)
## Overview
Our project is a recreation of 8ball pool. This is a turn-based game, intended to be played by two people on one device. This game follows the standard rules of 8ball pool and simulates the physics and mechanics of the game. Our game consists of a standard pool table with one cue ball and 15 numbered balls: one 8ball, seven striped balls, and seven solid balls. Players are able to adjust the power of their hits by utilizing the bar on the left of the board. They are also able to choose which direction they would like to hit the cue ball and shoot it. Our game also displays whose turn it is, and if they are supposed to aim for the solid or the striped balls. When a game ends, there will be an end screen that shows which player wins. Players are able to play again by pressing the enter button to reset the board.
## Instructions
Players can compile and run our game by opening it through Processing and running the sketch. The game will immediately begin and the first player can make their move.

When the balls are not moving, the player is able to aim the cue stick at the cue ball by clicking in the direction they would like the ball to go. Then, the player should click on the bar on the left, which will allow them to adjust the power of their hit. The top of the bar will result in less power while the bottom of the bar will result in more. The length of the white direction line indicates the power, while the direction represents the predicted path of the cue ball. Then, when the player is ready, they can shoot the ball by pressing the button on the bottom of the screen or by pressing the spacebar. If one of the player's balls, either striped or solid, goes into a pocket, their turn continues. If not, the player's turn ends and it becomes their opponent's turn. If the cue ball is shot in, the player's turn ends and the opponent gets to choose where to place the white ball before they shoot by clicking a spot on the board. If the player shoots the 8ball in before they get in all their balls, the game instantly ends and the opponent wins. If the player gets all their balls in and the 8ball in on their last turn, then the player wins.
